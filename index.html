            <h2>Early History</h2>
            <p>The cultivation of strawberries dates back to ancient times. Wild strawberries were consumed by indigenous peoples in North and South America as well as Europe. The garden strawberry as we know it today was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s. It was a hybrid of the wild Virginia strawberry from North America and the Chilean strawberry. This new breed combined the best traits of both, leading to larger and more flavorful fruits.</p>

            <h2>Modern Cultivation</h2>
            <p>Strawberry production underwent significant changes in the 19th and 20th centuries. Advances in agriculture and horticulture led to the development of new strawberry varieties that were more resistant to diseases and pests. The introduction of irrigation systems and fertilizers also improved yields. By the mid-20th century, commercial strawberry farming had become a major industry in countries like the United States, Japan, and Spain.</p>

            <h2>Current Production</h2>
            <p>Today, strawberries are produced worldwide, with major growers located in North America, Europe, and Asia. The United States is one of the largest producers, with California leading the way. Innovations in cultivation techniques, such as plasticulture and hydroponics, have further increased efficiency and production. The strawberry industry continues to evolve, with ongoing research into sustainable practices and new varieties that can thrive in diverse climates.</p>
